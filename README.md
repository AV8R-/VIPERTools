# VIPERTools

All you need to start using VIPER in your iOS project

## Integration

## Install xCode File Templates
### Using script
Open terminal and then run ```sudo swift InstallTemplates.swift```

### Manually

Copy folder named `VIPER` from project's root to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/`

Ok. Now you should be able to find new templates in New File menu under the section named VIPER (probably, at the last one).
It's 2 templates for `UIView` and `UIViewController` based VIPER modules

## Add ViperModule.swift
Copy file named `ViperModule.swift` from project's root to your project
