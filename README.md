# VIPERTools for Swift 4

All you need to start using VIPER in your iOS project. 
This Clean Architecture divides an appâ€™s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility, makes it easier to isolate dependencies, maintain and test your iOS project of any size!

## Integration


## Install xCode File Templates

### Using xCode
Open demo project, choose `CodeTemplates` target and run. 
If there is a `sudo` problem appears, make sure you have `Debug process as` `root` set up under the `Edit Scheme/Run`

### Using terminal
Open terminal and then run ```sudo swift VIPERToolsDemo/CodeTemplates/main.swift```

### Manually
Copy folder `/CodeTemplates/VIPER` from the project's root to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/`

Ok. Now you should be able to find new templates in `New File` menu under the section named VIPER (probably, the last one).
It's 2 templates for `UIView` and `UIViewController`-based VIPER modules

## Add ViperModule.swift
Copy file named `ViperModule.swift` from project's root to your project
